# Fine-grained analysis

## How to run
1. Get the latest version of `AlgoWiki algorithms (our copy) - Reductions.csv`
2. Install python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.ipynb`

This will generate the images in the `impactful_edges_by_size` and `impactful_edges_by_num_sccs` folders. And tables.

[You can find the list of impactful edges by size here.](https://github.com/andrewlucasgs/algorithms-reductions/blob/main/impactful_edges_by_size_table.md)

[You can find the list of impactful edges by number of SCCs here.](https://github.com/andrewlucasgs/algorithms-reductions/blob/main/num_sccs_table.md)
